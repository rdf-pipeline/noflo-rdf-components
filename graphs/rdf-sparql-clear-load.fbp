# rdf-sparql-clear-load.fbp

# Takes RDF JS Interface Graph object and inserts it into the target-graph (IRI) at the sparql-endpoint.
# The optional inport auth_file_env is an environment variable name that contains a file name, which contains the base64 encoded username:password to be included for HTTP Basic authentication.
# Similar to to rdf-clear-insert.fbp, but uses SPARQL LOAD instead. This allows for
# more triples to be sent at once, but require the remote endpoint to have http
# access to this system through the BASE_URL, such as http://localhost:1337/
# If a reverse tunnel is need, maybe a command like this will help: ssh -R 1337:localhost:1337 192.168.0.1
