# rdf-insert-jsonld.fbp

# Takes parsed JSON-LD and inserts it into the target-graph (IRI) at the sparql-endpoint.
# The optional inport auth_file_env is an environment variable name that contains a file name, which contains the base64 encoded username:password to be included for HTTP Basic authentication.
# The TARGET_GRAPH_URI port is optional and must be set before the RDF_GRAPH is serialized (possible race condition)
# The RDF_GRAPH is serialized into sparql-update as a single command via insert-graph-tokens.ru.hbs
# This is similar to rdf-clear-insert-jsonld.fbp, but it does not reset the remote graph
